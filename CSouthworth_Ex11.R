### we started with this basic model
# time points to simulate over (simulate for 100 years)
# a place to store population sizes (value of state variable through time)
# values for our parameters (r=0.2, K=100)
# a loop for simulating
# initial starting place; N0=2




# set parameter and state variable values
rn = .1
rm = .1
K = 1000000
timesteps = 1 # <- this isn't supposed to be one, change it
# not sure how many timesteps we need to run the model to equilibrium?

# create vector to store N's and set initial N


# create vector to store M's and set initial M
