#### Exercise 11 ####
## Generate a script that simulates growth of the two sub-populations 
##  in the tumor to equilibrium followed by drug treatment. 
##  Plot your results using a line graph.

## population growth equations
#   Non-mutant: N(t+1) = Nt + rN * Nt * (1 - (Nt + Mt)/K)
#   Mutant: M(t+1) = Mt + rM * Mt * (1 - (Nt + Mt)/K)

## Known values
#   K = 1,000,000
#   N0 = 100 for mutant pop
#   drug absent -> both grow at r = 0.1
#   drug present --> rN = -0.1, rM = 0.05



## Steps
# make dataframe with growth for each population and +/- drug
#   3 columns: days, Npop, Mpop
# for loop for Npop using equation and append to Npop vector
# for loop with "if else" to start Mpop at 100 cells
#   if: (Npop) output[i,2]<100 then (Mpop) output[i,3]=0
#   else if: output[i,2]=100 then output[i,3]=1
#   else: output[i,2]>100 then ***equation for Mpop***
# for loop for recognizing when it reaches equilibrium
#   looking for when output[i-1,2]=output[i,2]
#   if: output[i-1,2] != output[i,2] then keep appending with Npop equation
#   else if: output[i-1,2]=output[i,2] STOP
#   else?
# for loop to start drug equations (new r) and append to each pop
# load ggplot and plot line graph

# set timesteps to simulate
days <- 1:100

# place to store output
output <- data.frame(days=days, Npop=NA, Mpop=NA)

# establish initial populations for both
output[1,2]=2
