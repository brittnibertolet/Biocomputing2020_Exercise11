#### Exercise 11 ####
## Generate a script that simulates growth of the two sub-populations 
##  in the tumor to equilibrium followed by drug treatment. 
##  Plot your results using a line graph.

## population growth equations
#   Non-mutant: N(t+1) = Nt + rN * Nt * (1 - (Nt + Mt)/K)
#   Mutant: M(t+1) = Mt + rM * Mt * (1 - (Nt + Mt)/K)

## Known values
#   K = 1,000,000
#   N0 = 100 for mutant pop
#   drug absent -> both grow at r = 0.1
#   drug present --> rN = -0.1, rM = 0.05
